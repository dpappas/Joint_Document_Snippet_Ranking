# A Neural Model for Joint Document and Snippet Ranking in Question Answering for Large Document Collections

This is the implementation of ["A Neural Model for Joint Document and Snippet Ranking in Question Answering for Large Document Collections"](http://google.com) in Pytorch presented in ACL IJCNLP 2021.

### File Overview

### Data Processing

For Pubmed indexing we used ElasticSearch v5.0.1 with Lucene v6.2.1 

For Modified Natural Questions indexing we used ElasticSearch v7.10.0 with Lucene v8.7.0
First you need to download the [official dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/download).
